## About Me üòÑ
After completing a background in economics and finance, which includes a Baccalaureate in Economic and Social Sciences, a BTS in Banking, and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Banking and Finance from Cr√©dit Agricole, I gained solid experience in banking management, client advisory, and financial analysis. My role in customer service allowed me to develop skills in risk management and financial products. Eager to take on new challenges, I decided to redirect my career towards IT, combining my analytical skills with modern technologies. This career shift enables me to merge my interest in systems and analysis with my desire to contribute to innovative technological solutions.
